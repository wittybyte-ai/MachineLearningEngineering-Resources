- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
- **Calculus**: Differentiation, integration, gradients, and optimization.

### Algorithms and Data Structures

- Basic Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables.
- Advanced Data Structures: Trees, graphs, heaps.
- Algorithm Techniques: Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms.

### Machine Learning Research Papers (Do give them a good read):

The field of Machine Learning and AI is fast moving (atleast that’s how it has been since the launch of ChatGPT). There is so much incremental developments happening all the time that its very easy to get lost in the sea of research papers. The following list is a very small subset of curated papers which (in cronological order) have played a significant role in brining LLMs to the current stage:

1. Transformers (Where it all began!): [**"Attention Is All You Need"**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) 
2. GPT 1: [Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training ](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) 
3. GPT 2: [Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) 
4. GPT 3: [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf) 
5. Codex (GPT starts to code): [Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03374.pdf) 
6. LLaMa (Meta’s Foundation Open Source): [LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models](https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/333078981_693988129081760_4712707815225756708_n.pdf?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad8a9d&_nc_ohc=wcG4AAK8sL0AX86rKAQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AfDJ4lmd4CiMeo9yonblOFRIZmy9Fsww5F5YizYLoriD0A&oe=651C93A2) 
7. LLaMa 2 (Lets democratize LLMs) : [Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf) 

## **Books (To ground your understanding):**

- *"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"* by Bishop: A seminal piece that offers deep insights into pattern recognition, vital for any budding ML engineer.
- *"Deep Learning"* by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville: As the name suggests, it’s an essential read for diving into deep learning.
- *"Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective"* by Kevin Murphy: A detailed look into the probabilistic side of ML.
